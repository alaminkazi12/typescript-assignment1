Interfaces vs. Types and The power of keyof in Typescript

ypeScript is a supercharged version of JavaScript that adds types to make your code more predictable and easier to debug. In this blog I will share about the Interface vs. Types and keyof that is fundamental in Typescript. So let's dive into the main area of this blog.

Interfaces vs. Types
-Both help define shapes for data, but they work differently: -**Interfaces** can be merged (combined if named the same). -**Types** can mix different shapes ("yes" | "no" or [number, string]).
-We should use interfaces for objects and types for more complex needs.

**The keyof Keyword**
Gets all keys of an object for clean and safer code:

**typescript**
const person = { name: "Alex", age: 30 };  
type PersonKeys = keyof typeof person;

**When to use?**

-**interface** → For objects and classes -**type** → For flexible definitions -**keyof** → When working with object keys
