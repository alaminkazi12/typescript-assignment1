# Interfaces vs. Types and the Power of `keyof` in TypeScript

_A short but helpful blog_

TypeScript is a supercharged version of JavaScript that adds types to make your code more predictable and easier to debug. In this blog, I’ll share insights on **Interfaces vs. Types** and the **`keyof`** keyword—two fundamental concepts in TypeScript.

Let’s dive in.

---

## Interfaces vs. Types

Both interfaces and types help define the shape of data, but they behave differently:

- **Interfaces**

  - Can be **merged** (if they have the same name).
  - Best used for object and class structure.

- **Types**
  - Can represent **unions**, **intersections**, or even primitive values.
  - More flexible for advanced type definitions (e.g., `"yes" | "no"` or `[number, string]`).

✅ **Use interfaces for objects and classes.**  
✅ **Use types for complex or varied structures.**

## The `keyof` Keyword

The `keyof` operator lets you extract all keys of an object type, enabling safer and more dynamic code.

```typescript
const person = { name: "Alex", age: 30 };
type PersonKeys = keyof typeof person;
// Result: "name" | "age"

##When to use?

| Keyword    | Best Use Case                                |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `interface` | For objects and class definitions             |
| `type`      | For unions, tuples, and flexible definitions  |
| `keyof`     | When working with object keys dynamically     |
